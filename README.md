# Bootstrap-Portfolio

In this Page, I used bootstrap mainly for the styling of the page. I also added some style so as to fit what i was requiered to do. 
WHAT IS BOOTSTRAP:
Bootstrap is a free and open-source front-end library for designing websites and web applications. It contains HTML- and CSS-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components, as well as optional JavaScript extensions. We link the bootstrap to our HTML by adding link into our head tag. So inour link, rel stand for relationship,i.e. the relationship it has to our page, and in this case its styling. 
 Right after our bootstrap link I added a style tag. this is where the additional styling is going to get in to. For us to reder to an element in the style we either use a # which is an id selector or a "." which is a class selector. These two selectors a specific i.e. they styling will work only to the elements that have this specific selectors and with a specific name. Then we also have a general  way of selecting elements by just writing out the element name.

 After the head we have the body. This is where every thing we can see when we open our browser goes in to. In our body tag. In our body tag, we have a div which stands for division. The div tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document.The div element is often used as a container for other HTML elements to style them with CSS. We have a series of classes which all styled in the bootstrap. 
  
  From lines 83-85, we linked our portfolio and contact and our index.html pages so that when we click we will be able to open these pages.
  The footer tag defines a footer for our document. And in our footer we can fine our copyright information. This is usually the last bottom part of a page. 

  P.S it is also good to note we cant really give enough discription about our classes and style because we are using botstrap and the styling is done by bootstrap.
